# `todo-view`

## Generate the project

The following command was used to generate the library

**` ng g library todo-view --style=scss --prefix=todo`**

## Refactor

I had to explicitly create .scss and .html as both the styles and html were inline

## Test

`ng test todo-view`

## Added ng-bootstrap

**`npm i --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap`**
